It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and was done as part of our 5th Semester project.

Main aim of this project was to build a model to scrape reviews of a product from e-commerce
websites, extract the features (such as battery in case of a cell phone) of the product using these
reviews, generate ratings on these features and finally generate the overall rating of the product.

The GUI part of the project was implemented using Java whereas the backend was developed
using Python. Various libraries such as numpy, swing were used to build this model.

This project was an implementation of a Google's research paper: Building a Sentiment
Summarizer for Local Service Reviews.
